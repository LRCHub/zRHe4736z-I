She's dancing alone
In the dark by herself
Out on the floor
Like there's nobody else
Under the light
While she's under a spell
I had to slide
Cause I could'nt waste my time

As I walked by Then we locked eyes on the floor
Left right Let the beat rock out the door
Don't stop Cause you can't hide anymore
Lights down But she don't mind in the dark
Nights out Where she blow lines into dust
'Til she's feeling no emotion

She's dancing alone
In the dark
She's dancing alone
Dancing alone baby
And I wonder why
She's dancing alone
Dancing alone baby

She's tearing apart
Fire sparks when she dance
Outshining the dark
Like a star heaven's sent
Lost in the crowd
Every hour we spent
We've come too far
Now won't you come and take my hand

So I walked by Again we locked eyes on the floor
Left right Let the beat rock out the door
Don't stop Cause you can't hide anymore
Lights down But she don't mind in the dark
Nights out Where she blow lines into dust
Don't you play with my emotions

She's dancing alone
In the dark
She's dancing alone
Dancing alone baby
And I wonder why
She's dancing alone
Dancing alone baby

She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing alone
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing alone
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing

She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing alone
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing alone
She's dancing (dancing)
Dancing
She's dancing alone
(Let's dance)

She's dancing alone
She's dancing alone
